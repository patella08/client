## Kegged.
A social beer app driven by user activity to discuss and discover breweries and brews in your local city.

Visit [Kegged](http://174.138.43.93/)!

## Motivation
It's tough deciding which brewery to go to on a given day. Breweries are always changing - the draft list changes, the setting changes, and maybe even management changes. Kegged is a one-stop app that allows locals to see cities, breweries, and beer lists and discuss them in an open forum with other users. With Kegged, you'll always know what to expect at a brewery on any given day.
